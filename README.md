# Profile Generator

## Description

This project is about creating a HTML page about a github user with a node command. The user intializes javascript file by a node command. Once the file initializes, the file will return with a prompt asking the user to enter a Git Hub username. Once the use enters a Git Hub userename, the file will then create a HTML page that has basic information of that Git Hub user.

This javascript code incorporates npm modules that commincate with websites and various other packages that make many javascipt functionalities easier to create. For this instance we were able to submit a userinput and have it return username data and we were able to create a HTML page of that github user in few lines of code. The simplicity of npm packages allows for the incorporation of many functions without many problems. Additionally, being ablt to dynamically generate multiple different html pages with ease allows the user for this instance to quickly look at multiple different users.
